The SHMAC system is an intelligent home access control system developed based on the Flask and Frida frameworks. The system adopts a classic server-browser (B/S) architecture, where the server can run on Windows or Linux systems, and the client's webpage only needs any H5-supported browser to run. In order to make the SHMAC system easier to use in a home environment, this paper introduces a method to run the SHMAC server on an Android phone. With this method, the SHMAC system in the application scenario of smart homes only needs a smartphone to realize all functions.
